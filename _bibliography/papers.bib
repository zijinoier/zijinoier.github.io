  abstract    = {In this paper, we explore the potential of using a large language model (LLM) to understand the driving environment in a human-like manner and analyze its ability to reason, interpret, and memorize when facing complex scenarios. We argue that traditional optimization-based and modular autonomous driving (AD) systems face inherent performance limitations when dealing with long-tail corner cases. To address this problem, we propose that an ideal AD system should drive like a human, accumulating experience through continuous driving and using common sense to solve problems. To achieve this goal, we identify three key abilities necessary for an AD system: reasoning, interpretation, and memorization. We demonstrate the feasibility of employing an LLM in driving scenarios by building a closed-loop system to showcase its comprehension and environment-interaction abilities. Our extensive experiments show that the LLM exhibits the impressive ability to reason and solve long-tailed cases, providing valuable insights for the development of human-like autonomous driving.},

  abstract    = {With the growing popularity of digital twin and autonomous driving in transportation, the demand for simulation systems capable of generating high-fidelity and reliable scenarios is increasing. Existing simulation systems suffer from a lack of support for different types of scenarios, and the vehicle models used in these systems are too simplistic. Thus, such systems fail to represent driving styles and multi-vehicle interactions, and struggle to handle corner cases in the dataset. In this paper, we propose LimSim, the Long-term Interactive Multi-scenario traffic Simulator, which aims to provide a long-term continuous simulation capability under the urban road network. LimSim can simulate fine-grained dynamic scenarios and focus on the diverse interactions between multiple vehicles in the traffic flow. This paper provides a detailed introduction to the framework and features of the LimSim, and demonstrates its performance through case studies and experiments. LimSim is now open source on GitHub.},

  abstract    = {With the commercial application of automated vehicles (AVs), the sharing of roads between AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) becomes a common occurrence in the future. While research has focused on improving the safety and reliability of autonomous driving, it's also crucial to consider collaboration between AVs and HVs. Human-like interaction is a required capability for AVs, especially at common unsignalized intersections, as human drivers of HVs expect to maintain their driving habits for inter-vehicle interactions. This paper uses the social value orientation (SVO) in the decision-making of vehicles to describe the social interaction among multiple vehicles. Specifically, we define the quantitative calculation of the conflict-involved SVO at unsignalized intersections to enhance decision-making based on the reinforcement learning method. We use naturalistic driving scenarios with highly interactive motions for performance evaluation of the proposed method. Experimental results show that SVO is more effective in characterizing inter-vehicle interactions than conventional motion state parameters like velocity, and the proposed method can accurately reproduce naturalistic driving trajectories compared to behavior cloning.},

We propose a hierarchical multi-vehicle decision-making and planning framework with several advantages. The framework makes decisions jointly for all vehicles within the traffic flow and reacts promptly to the dynamic environment through a high-frequency planning module. The decision module produces interpretable action sequences that can explicitly communicate self-intentions to the surrounding HVs. We also present the cooperation factor and the trajectory weight set, which bring diversity to autonomous vehicles in traffic at both the social and individual levels.},

  abstract    = {Multi-Agent Path Finding has been widely studied in the past few years due to its broad application in the field of robotics and AI. However, previous solvers rely on several simplifying assumptions. This limits their applicability in numerous real-world domains that adopt nonholonomic car-like agents rather than holonomic ones. In this paper, we give a mathematical formalization of the Multi-Agent Path Finding for Car-Like robots (CL-MAPF) problem. We propose a novel hierarchical search-based solver called Car-Like Conflict-Based Search to address this problem. It applies a body conflict tree to address collisions considering the shapes of the agents. We introduce a new algorithm called Spatiotemporal Hybrid-State A* as the single-agent planner to generate agents’ paths satisfying both kinematic and spatiotemporal constraints. We also present a sequential planning version of our method, sacrificing a small amount of solution quality to achieve a significant reduction in runtime. We compare our method with two baseline algorithms on a dedicated benchmark and validate it in real-world scenarios. The experiment results show that the planning success rate of both baseline algorithms is below 50\% for all six scenarios, while our algorithm maintains that of over 98\%. It also gives clear evidence that our algorithm scales well to 100 agents in 300 m × 300 m scenario and is able to produce solutions that can be directly applied to Ackermann-steering robots in the real world. The benchmark and source code are released in https://github.com/APRIL-ZJU/CL-CBS. The video of the experiments can be found on YouTube.},

  abstract    = {In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate method for autonomous surface vehicles to generate a smooth and collision-free trajectory considering its dynamics constraints. We decouple the trajectory planning problem as a front-end feasible path searching and a back-end kinodynamic trajectory optimization. Firstly, we model the type of two-thrusts under-actuated surface vessel. Then we adopt a sampling-based path searching to find an asymptotic optimal path through the obstacle-surrounding environment and extract several waypoints from it. We apply a numerical optimization method in the back-end to generate the trajectory. From the perspective of security in the field voyage, we propose the sailing corridor method to guarantee the trajectory away from obstacles. Moreover, considering limited fuel ASV carrying, we design a numerical objective function which can optimize a fuel-saving trajectory. Finally, we validate and compare the proposed method in simulation environments and the results fit our expected trajectory.},

However, agents with different tasks sharing the same network parameters are not conducive to distinguishing the agents' skills. In addition, the importance of communication between agents undertaking the same task is much higher than that with external agents. Therefore, we propose Dual Cooperation Networks (DCN). In order to distinguish whether agents undertake the same task, all agents are grouped according to their status through the graph neural network instead of the traditional proximity. The agent communicates within the group to achieve strong cooperation. After that, the global value function is decomposed by groups to facilitate cooperation between groups. Finally, we have verified it in simulation and physical hardware, and the algorithm has achieved excellent performance.},

  abstract    = {Multi-agent path finding in formation has many potential real-world applications like mobile warehouse robotics. However, previous multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods hardly take formation into consideration. Further-more, they are usually centralized planners and require the whole state of the environment. Other decentralized partially observable approaches to MAPF are reinforcement learning (RL) methods. However, these RL methods encounter difficulties when learning path finding and formation problems at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized partially observable RL algorithm that uses a hierarchical structure to decompose the multi-objective task into unrelated ones. It also calculates a theoretical weight that makes each tasks reward has equal influence on the final RL value function. Additionally, we introduce a communication method that helps agents cooperate with each other. Experiments in simulation show that our method outperforms other end-to-end RL methods and our method can naturally scale to large world sizes where centralized planner struggles. We also deploy and validate our method in a real-world scenario.},
