I am currently a researcher at the <a href="https://www.shlab.org.cn/">Shanghai AI Laboratory</a>, where I also collaborate closely with the <a href="https://www.sii.edu.cn/">Shanghai Institute of Innovation</a>.  <br>I received my M.Sc. degree from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2022, where I was a member of the [APRIL Lab](https://april.zju.edu.cn/), advised by [Dr. Yong Liu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yongliu). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University in 2019.

My research focuses on enabling AI agents to operate efficiently in practical and valuable scenarios, with an emphasis on allowing foundation models to learn and improve during *run-time* rather than solely at *design-time*. 
My prior work centered on addressing complex interaction challenges in autonomous driving. I am passionate about the future of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and excited to contribute to these rapidly advancing fields.
