 I am currently a young researcher in  <a href="https://pjlab-adg.github.io/">ADLab</a> at <a href="https://www.shlab.org.cn/">Shanghai AI Laboratory</a>. I earned my MSc degree from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2022, where I was a member of the [APRIL Lab](https://april.zju.edu.cn/) under the guidance of [Dr. Yong Liu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yongliu). Prior to this, I got my bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University in 2019.

My research centers on addressing complex interaction challenges through closed-loop knowledge-driven autonomous driving. I am passionate about the future of autonomous driving and artificial general intelligence (AGI), and I am thrilled to contribute to these rapidly advancing fields.

### Research Interests
