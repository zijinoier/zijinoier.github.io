 I am currently a young researcher in  <a href="https://pjlab-adg.github.io/">ADLab</a> at <a href="https://www.shlab.org.cn/">Shanghai AI Laboratory</a>. I graduated from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) with a MSc degree in 2022, as a member of <a href="https://april.zju.edu.cn/"> APRIL Lab</a> under the mentorship of  <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/yongliu">Dr. Yong Liu</a>. Prior to this, I got my bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University in 2019.

My primary focus is on resolving complex interaction and planning problems between multiple vehicles in autonomous driving. I am also a firm believer in the eventual realization of both autonomous driving and artificial general intelligence (AGI), and I am excited to be a part of this rapidly evolving field.

The following are my current research interests:
