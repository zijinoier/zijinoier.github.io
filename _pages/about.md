 I am currently a young researcher at <a href="https://www.shlab.org.cn/">Shanghai AI Laboratory</a>. I graduated from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) with a MSc degree in 2022, supervised by <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/yongliu">Prof. Yong Liu</a>. Before that, I got my bachelor's degree from College of Control Sciense and Engineering, Zhejiang University in 2019.

My primary focus is on resolving complex decision and planning problems between multiple vehicles in autonomous driving. I am also a firm believer in the eventual realization of both autonomous driving and artificial general intelligence (AGI), and I am excited to be a part of this rapidly evolving field.


The following are my current research interests. See also [list of publications](/publications).

- Autonomous Driving
- Human-like Decision Making
- Emobodied AI
- Mobile Robots
